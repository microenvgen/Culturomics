This folder contains several scripts to automate the production of amplicon sequencing libraries from liquid samples. These scripts can also be used for other purposes.

MicrovolumeDNAextraction (automated DNA extration, following "Bramucci, A. R., Focardi, A., Rinke, C., Hugenholtz, P., Tyson, G. W., Seymour, J. R., & Raina, J.-B. (2021). Microvolume DNA extraction methods for microscale amplicon and metagenomic studies. ISME Communications, 1(1), 1â€“5.")
