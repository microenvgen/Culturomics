From MinIon fastq output to 1-file per well

This script runs in a UNIX environment that has `cutadapt` v 4.6 or newer available. The script requires a parameters file, where the user can change the location of the raw reads, the output folder and the metadata file where the demultiplexing adapaters are found.

To use it, type

```bash <path_to_demultiplex_anchors.sh> <path_to_parameters_file>```
